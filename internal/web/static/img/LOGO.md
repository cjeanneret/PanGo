# PanGo Logo

The original logo (`logo-pango.png`) was generated using **Perplexity** (AI assistant). Perplexity was provided with the project repository and produced both the prompt and the icon via its internal image generation tool.

## Prompt

> A modern, technical app icon for a pan-tilt photography controller system. The design features an abstract geometric representation of a two-axis gimbal mechanism: two perpendicular rotating axes or rings intersecting at right angles, suggesting precision movement in horizontal and vertical directions. The composition uses clean lines, angular shapes, and a wireframe or blueprint aesthetic. A small circular element at the center hints at a camera lens without being literal. The color scheme uses electric blue, cyan, and dark charcoal gray with subtle metallic gradients. The icon has a dark background with the mechanical elements in bright, contrasting colors. The overall style is technical, precise, and distinctly different from social media apps - more engineering-focused with sharp angles rather than curves. Square format, suitable for an application icon.
